<p>I left this place a lifetime ago. Yet it has been calling me. I updated my theme. It's still bad, but one day it will look as good as I want.</p>

<p>Hello again. I decided to clean this place from ground up. Removed third-party theme and started my own. It will be fun.</p>

<p>Changed appearance a little. Now it feels more comfortable. At least, for me?</p>

<p>Returned to this old plants. Mouse stars were bugged and they were causing lag so I fixed them. Maybe I should start creating my own theme?</p>
